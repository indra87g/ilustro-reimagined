# Let's Port Rainmeter

Let's port rainmeter (LPR) is a campaign to make Rainmeter available in every platform, not only in Windows (on Linux, Android, etc). 
It can make the Rainmeter user/developer community is bigger.

**Porting Rainmeter ? - It's Possible ?**
I think it's possible, because Rainmeter is created with C++ and the good news,
C++ is available for every platform. for example, [PPSSPP]() is created with
C++ and it's available in Windows, MacOS, IOS and Android. And *why Rainmeter cant?*

**Why Porting Rainmeter ?**
After porting Rainmeter to target platform, what we get ?
I think, we can get this things :
- Bigger Community
- More User and Developer

**How to Port Rainmeter ?**
